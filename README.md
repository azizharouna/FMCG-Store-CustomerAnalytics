# FMG-Store-Customer-Analytics-using-Deep-Learning
Customer behavior insights of a Fast moving goods store  are extracted and analysed. After pre-processing the data we used Logistic regression (mono and  multinominal) to segment the data into 4 cluster and categorize each new customer data. We analysed the model to find
- The purchase probability modeling and its Predictive Analysis
- The probability of (chocolate bar) brand choice   and its Predictive Analysis
- The purchase quantity modeling and its  Predictive Analysis

a deep learning model is build in order to predictic the customer conversion 

-	Customers conversion prediction using deep learning 
o	Brand choice models with multinominal logistic regression (learning in nmulti class scenario
